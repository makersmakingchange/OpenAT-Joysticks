 # OpenAT Joysticks Project
The OpenAT Joysticks are a set of open-source designs for input devices intended for people with disabilities. The joysticks are intended to be simple to make either as a Do-it-Yourself (DIY) or Do-it-Together (DIT) project, or through the community of volunteer makers at Makers Making Change.

The hardware, software, and documentation are released under licenses compatible with open source hardware; the designs may be built, used, and improved upon by anyone under the terms of the license. Generally, this includes attribution and sharing of improvements.

If you have built any of the OpenAT Joysticks, you can provide feedback by filling out this [build feedback questionnaire](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DsX1YrmQmUWIO5C199RGrFEDZSGvzl5MrPC-gnb-_DxUNkpaSUlVN1NUSDk3RzQ5ODY0MjBVSDYxSy4u). 

A limited number of these devices may be available at no-cost to people with disabilities that reside within Canada. If you think this applies to you, please send an email to info@makersmakingchange.com.
