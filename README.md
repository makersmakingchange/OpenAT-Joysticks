 # OpenAT Joysticks Project
The OpenAT Joysticks are a set of open-source designs for input devices intended for people with disabilities. The joysticks are intended to be simple to make either as a Do-it-Yourself (DIY) or Do-it-Together (DIT) project, or through the community of volunteer makers at Makers Making Change.

The hardware, software, and documentation are released under licenses compatible with open source hardware; the designs may be built, used, and improved upon by anyone under the terms of the license. Generally, this includes attribution and sharing of improvements.

If you have built any of the OpenAT Joysticks, you can provide feedback by filling out this [build feedback questionnaire](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DsX1YrmQmUWIO5C199RGrFEDZSGvzl5MrPC-gnb-_DxUNkpaSUlVN1NUSDk3RzQ5ODY0MjBVSDYxSy4u).

## Completed Designs

### Oak Compact Joystick
The Oak Compact Joystick is a medium sized proportional joystick that can be used for adaptive gaming. It has range of motion of approximately ±25° and requires 525 grams-force to fully deflect. 
This joystick has a single output cables, a 3.5 mm TRRS audio plug (i.e., headphone jack) for the joystick. It is compatible with the X1 or X2 analog input ports on the Microsoft Xbox Adaptive controller as well as the Forest Joystick Mouse Hub for use as a USB Mouse or USB Gamepad.

### Spruce Mini Joystick 
The Spruce Mini Joystick is a mini sized proportional joystick that can be used for adaptive gaming. Based on a generic game controller thumbstick, it has range of motion of ±30° and requires approximately 75 grams-force to fully deflect. This joystick has a two output cables, one with a 3.5 mm TRRS audio plug (i.e., headphone jack) for the joystick, and one with a 3.5 mm mono audio plug for the push switch. It is compatible with the X1 or X2 analog input ports on the Microsoft Xbox Adaptive controller as well as the Forest Joystick Mouse Hub for use as a USB Mouse or USB Gamepad.

### LipSync
The LipSync is a mouth-operated sip-and-puff joystick that can act as a USB HID mouse, wireless Bluetooth mouse, or USB HID gamepad. It enables people with disabililites that limit their mobility to control a computer, gaming console, smart phone, or tablet. The joystick mouthpiece has a range of ±10° (about ±1 cm) and requires 50 grams-force to fully deflect.

### Redwood Joystick
The Redwood Joystick is designed for users with gross motor movement and high strength, providing a durable and reliable solution for adaptive gaming and digital access. With its USB connection, it functions seamlessly as a computer mouse or gamepad, offering flexibility to suit your needs. Compatible with our [Oak Compact Joystick toppers](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/Oak-Compact-Joystick/tree/main/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files/Toppers), it can be customized with options like goalpost or concave designs for personalized comfort. The joystick’s robust construction ensures it withstands heavy use, while its mounting adapters allow secure attachment to 1/4-20 mounting arms and 1-inch RAM mounts, ensuring a stable and accessible setup in any environment.

## Prototypes
The following designs are still works in progress.

### Cedar Mini Joystick
The Cedar Mini Joystick is a small USB joystick that can act as either an USB HID Gamepad or as a USB HID Mouse. It has a relatively small range of motion and a moderately low force required. In Joystick mode, it is compatible with the Xbox Adaptive Controller.

### Birch Mini Joystick
The Birch Mini Joystick is a small, proportional joystick that has a sliding motion and can be used for adaptive gaming. It has a small range of motion of ±2mm and requires approximately 115 grams-force to fully deflect. It is low profile, with a height of 2.4 mm with the standard topper. This joystick has interchangable toppers and an optional camera mount adapter. The Birch Mini Joystick is available in two variants: a USB variant (U) and an analog, non-USB variant (A). The joystick and enclosure are the same in both variants and differ by the cable and internal electronics.
