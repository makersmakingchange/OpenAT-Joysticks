 # OpenAT Joysticks

<!--- 
SUMMARY
 --->

The OpenAT Joysticks are a set of open-source designs for input devices intended for people with disabilities. The joysticks are intended to be simple to make either as a Do-it-Yourself (DIY) or Do-it-Together (DIT) project, or through the community of volunteer makers at Makers Making Change.

The hardware, software, and documentation are released under licenses compatible with open source hardware; the designs may be built, used, and improved upon by anyone under the terms of the license. Generally, this includes attribution and sharing of improvements.

If you have built any of the OpenAT Joysticks, you can provide feedback by filling out this [build feedback questionnaire](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DsX1YrmQmUWIO5C199RGrFEDZSGvzl5MrPC-gnb-_DxUNkpaSUlVN1NUSDk3RzQ5ODY0MjBVSDYxSy4u).

### Oak Compact Joystick
The Oak Compact Joystick is a medium sized proportional joystick that can be used for adaptive gaming. It has range of motion of approximately ±25° and requires 525 grams-force to fully deflect. The Oak Compact Joystick is available in two variants: a USB variant (U) and a non-USB variant (A). The joystick and enclosure are the same in both variants and differ by the cable and internal electronics.

### Cedar Mini Joystick
The Cedar Mini Joystick is a small USB joystick that can act as either an HID gamepad or as a mouse. It has a relatively small range of motion and a moderately low force required. In Joystick mode, it is compatible with the Xbox Adaptive Controller.

### Birch Mini Joystick
The Birch Mini Joystick is a small, proportional joystick that has a sliding motion and can be used for adaptive gaming. It has a small range of motion of ±2mm and requires approximately 115 grams-force to fully deflect. It is low profile, with a height of 2.4 mm with the standard topper. This joystick has interchangable toppers and an optional camera mount adapter. The Birch Mini Joystick is available in two variants: a USB variant (U) and an analog, non-USB variant (A). The joystick and enclosure are the same in both variants and differ by the cable and internal electronics.

### Ivy Nunchuck Joystick Adapter
The Ivy Nunchuck Adapter enables a Nunchuck controller to be used as a USB HID Mouse or USB HID Gamepad. The Nunchuck controller provides a thumb joystick and two buttons in a graspable controller.

### Wheelchair Bluetooth Joystick Adapter
The Wheelchair Bluetooth Joystick Adapter enables a user to use their powerchair joystick via a Bluetooth Mouse module as a joystick on a computer or gaming console.
